I work on tons of hobby projects, mostly web-based games. (Maybe some useful stuff once in a while ðŸ˜­)<br>
I'm trying to teach myself some useful JS libraries, flexbox, maybe expand my knowledge to C++<br>
I also mess around with some backend server stuff if I get __really__ bored~<br>

##### Coding aside~

My pronouns are She/They.<br>
I also really enjoy music, it's the only things I take seriously. Favorite genres include: rock/metal, jazz, Phonk, Breakcore, and K/Jpop.<br>
Some of my favorite pieces of media/literature are: [Death of a Salesman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_a_Salesman), Any [Agatha Christie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agatha_Christie) book, and Carpenter Brut's Album, [Trilogy](https://open.spotify.com/album/5iPLQmPK5f0r69TPJcfAt2?si=0zdPwieUQMO2TqzYge1wFQ).<br>
I'm also pretty chatty, so HMU if you want, I guess~<br>
##### Safe to say my tastes are quite varied~
